# Iot_Restaurant_Quality_Management
- Restaurant management IoT topic is designed to monitor important parameters in restaurants such as temperature, humidity and gas. This system uses sensors to collect data and transmit information about these parameters to Google Firebase and the Website.<br><br>
- The website uses algorithms to analyze the data collected from the sensors and make appropriate decisions. If the gas level exceeds the safe level, the system will automatically activate a siren to alert the user. At the same time, the system can also automatically turn off electrical equipment such as lights and turn on the horn to ensure safety.<br><br>
- All data collected from sensors and control decisions are stored in a central server for more efficient monitoring and analysis. The system is also capable of providing reports and data analysis to help restaurant managers make more effective decisions in managing the working environment.<br><br>
